# Friend Finder

A simple `NodeJS` application that allows users to answer questions about themselves, and they are matched with the closest person in the friend.js file. Each person in the friends.js file is made up, I plan to add a back-end for this where users can match with other users. Each question is calculated by a number from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The user is matched by finding a person in the friends.js file with the smallest difference.
